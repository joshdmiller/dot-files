! ## URxt
! URxvt (also known as rxvt-unicode) is a lightweight but extensible X11
! terminal emulator. URxvt takes its configuration from this file as variables
! prefixed with its name. The variables used here are but a small sampling of
! those available, but should give the user some indication of its
! capabilities. Each variable is explained in more detail here.

! ### Basic Configuration

! The following variables hold aesthetic information about URxvt. Background
! and foreground are obvious. The font must be an XOrg font string, which can
! be selected graphically using the `xfontsel` tool. `scrollBar` indicates
! whether a scroll bar will be visible; other options include `left` and
! `right`.
! URxvt.background        : #141c21
! URxvt.foreground        : #93a1a1
URxvt.font              : xft:Source Code Pro SemiBold:pixelsize=20,xft:PowerlineSymbols
URxvt.letterSpace       : 1
URxvt.scrollBar         : off

Xcursor.theme           : Qogir
Xcursor.size            : 16

! URxvt by default does not support using the control+arrows to advance or
! retreat one word at a time. The following two codes re-enable this.
URxvt.keysym.C-Right    : \033[1;5C
URxvt.keysym.C-Left     : \033[1;5D

! ### Plugins

! One can extend URxvt using perl. The `perl-ext` and `perl-ext-common`
! variables list the plugins that should be loaded. These must exist in either
! the default path or one of the `perl-lib` paths defined above.
!
! * default - the Perl modules URxvt enables by default.
! * url-select - allows using the keyboad to select and copy URLs printed to the terminal.
! * clipboard - an extension for improved management of the clipboard,
!   including the use multiple buffers.
!
! There are two variables here because `perl-ext-common` is supposed to apply
! to all instances, whereas `perl-ext` would only apply to some instances. In
! most use cases, you will want to follow the pattern I use here, which is to
! place all custom plugins in `perl-ext-common`.
URxvt.perl-ext-common   : default,url-select,clipboard
URxvt.perl-ext          : default

! Here I specify some basic options for the `url-select` plugin. The
! `urlLauncher` is the application with which launched URLs will open.
! `underlineURLs` indicates that URLs should be visually identified by
! underlining them, similar to a web browser. Lastly, `urlButton` is the mouse
! button to use to launch URLs on click. I use the middle mouse button.
URxvt.urlLauncher       : chromium
URxvt.underlineURLs     : true
URxvt.urlButton         : 2

! The below commands are what the `clipboard` plugin will use to copy and
! paste. These are the default values that I listed for reference purposes.
! They use the `clipboard` buffer rather than the default use of the `primary`
! buffer, which will not work in other GUI applications as expected.
URxvt.copyCommand       : xsel -ibp
URxvt.pasteCommand      : xsel -obp

! ### Keybindings
!
! URxvt stores keybindings in a variable called `keysym`. The pattern for any
! keybinding is "modifier+hyphen+key". On most systems, the modifier C is
! Control, S is Shift, and M is Alt. The value assigned to the keybinding is
! the function to execute. My keybindings all point to perl extensions, so the
! format is `perl:<module>:function`.

! I map copy and paste to C+S+c and C+S+v.
URxvt.keysym.Shift-Control-C  : eval:selection_to_clipboard
URxvt.keysym.Shift-Control-V  : eval:paste_clipboard
URxvt.iso14755                : false
URxvt.iso14755_52             : false

! The keybinding to activate the default `url-select` plugin is Alt+u, so I map
! the same keybinding to the replacement.
URxvt.keysym.M-u        : perl:url-select:select_next
