! The `$HOME/.Xresources` file is the primary user-level configuration for X
! client applications.

! ## Xcursor

! These variables control the cursor theme used in X11. The available themes
! are listed in `/usr/share/icons` along with non-cursor icon themes. The size
! is the pixel size of the cursor to use.
Xcursor.theme           : Oxygen_Black
Xcursor.size            : 22

! ## URxt
! URxvt (also known as rxvt-unicode) is a lightweight but extensible X11
! terminal emulator. URxvt takes its configuration from this file as variables
! prefixed with its name. The variables used here are but a small sampling of
! those available, but should give the user some indication of its
! capabilities. Each variable is explained in more detail here.

! ### Basic Configuration

! URxvt can be extended using Perl scripts. The default directory for scripts
! is `/usr/lib/urxvt/perl`; since my scripts are not installed system-wide, I
! must provide it a colon-delimited list of directories from which to read
! scripts. See the README in that directory for details about the available
! plugins.
URxvt.perl-lib          : /home/joshua/Development/repos/dot-files/home/urxvt/perl

! The following variables hold aesthetic information about URxvt. Background
! and foreground are obvious. The font must be an XOrg font string, which can
! be selected graphically using the `xfontsel` tool. `scrollBar` indicates
! whether a scroll bar will be visible; other options include `left` and
! `right`.
URxvt.background        : black
URxvt.foreground        : white
URxvt.font              : -*-terminus-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
URxvt.scrollBar         : off

! URxvt by default does not support using the control+arrows to advance or
! retreat one word at a time. The following two codes re-enable this.
URxvt.keysym.C-Right    : \033[1;5C
URxvt.keysym.C-Left     : \033[1;5D

! ### Plugins

! One can extend URxvt using perl. The `perl-ext` and `perl-ext-common`
! variables list the plugins that should be loaded. These must exist in either
! the default path or one of the `perl-lib` paths defined above.
!
! * default - the Perl modules URxvt enables by default.
! * tabbedex - an improved version of the included `tabbed` created by stepb;
!   this plugin allows multiple tabs within the same window with the ability to
!   reorder and rename.
! * url-select - an improved version of the included plugin of the same name,
!   which allows using the keyboad to select and copy URLs printed to the
!   terminal.
! * clipboard - an extension for improved management of the clipboard,
!   including the use multiple buffers.
!
! There are two variables here because `perl-ext-common` is supposed to apply
! to all instances, whereas `perl-ext` would only apply to some instances. In
! most use cases, you will want to follow the pattern I use here, which is to
! place all custom plugins in `perl-ext-common`.
URxvt.perl-ext-common   : default,tabbedex,url-select,clipboard
URxvt.perl-ext          : default

! Here I specify some basic options for the `url-select` plugin. The
! `urlLauncher` is the application with which launched URLs will open.
! `underlineURLs` indicates that URLs should be visually identified by
! underlining them, similar to a web browser. Lastly, `urlButton` is the mouse
! button to use to launch URLs on click. I use the middle mouse button.
URxvt.urlLauncher       : firefox
URxvt.underlineURLs     : true
URxvt.urlButton         : 2

! The below commands are what the `clipboard` plugin will use to copy and
! paste. These are the default values that I listed for reference purposes.
! They use the `clipboard` buffer rather than the default use of the `primary`
! buffer, which will not work in other GUI applications as expected.
URxvt.copyCommand       : xsel -ibp
URxvt.pasteCommand      : xsel -obp

! ### Keybindings
!
! URxvt stores keybindings in a variable called `keysym`. The pattern for any
! keybinding is "modifier+hyphen+key". On most systems, the modifier C is
! Control, S is Shift, and M is Alt. The value assigned to the keybinding is
! the function to execute. My keybindings all point to perl extensions, so the
! format is `perl:<module>:function`.

! The default keybindings for moving tabs with `tabbedex` are C-Left and
! C-Right, but I re-assigned those earlier to advance and withdraw one word at
! a time. Here, I remap the tab move keybindings to Control-Shift-Left and
! Control-Shift-Right.
URxvt.keysym.M-S-Left   : perl:tabbedex:move_tab_left
URxvt.keysym.M-S-Right  : perl:tabbedex:move_tab_right

! I have mapped C-Down to create a new tab and C-Up to rename the current tab.
URxvt.keysym.S-Down  : perl:tabbedex:new_tab
URxvt.keysym.S-Up  : perl:tabbedex:rename_tab

! As the C+S+v and C+S+c are already used by URxvt for internal functions, I
! mapped copy and paste to Alt+c and Alt+v.
URxvt.keysym.M-c        : perl:clipboard:copy
URxvt.keysym.M-v        : perl:clipboard:paste
URxvt.keysym.M-C-v      : perl:clipboard:paste_escaped

! The keybinding to activate the default `url-select` plugin is Alt+u, so I map
! the same keybinding to the replacement.
URxvt.keysym.M-u        : perl:url-select:select_next
