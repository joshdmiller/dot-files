-- # TOP & BOTTOM BARS

-- In order to mange workspaces and layouts visually, XMonad can pipe information
-- to other applications. For my configuration, I use [dzen2][dzen] to draw the
-- top and bottom bars. In addition to piping XMonad information like
-- workspaces to dzen, I use [conky][conky] to pipe system information to a
-- dzen bar. This configuration contains three dzen bars:
-- 
-- 1. The bottom-right - conky pipes system stats to dzen2
-- 2. The bottom-left - xmonad pipes workspace/layout/window information to dzen2
--
-- This section also contains configuration information for a program launcher
-- called Prompt that is part of XMonad.
--
-- For the two dzen2 bars that get their information from conky, please see the files
-- in the `bin` directory of my package: conky_bar for the top right and conky_bar_bottom
-- for the bottom left. These two files contain the configuration for the conky
-- output that is piped to dzen in the top-right, bottom-right, and
-- bottom-left.
--
-- [conky]: http://conky.sourceforge.net/
-- [dzen]: https://sites.google.com/site/gotmor/dzen

-- ## General Dzen Options

-- First, the following options are passed to all instances of dzen we launch
-- here. They define the basic colors used as well as the height, which we want
-- to remain consistent to ensure the bars look like a top and bottom bar
-- instead of four separate bars.
userDzenGenOpts    = "-fg '" ++ themeFgColor ++ "' -bg '" ++ themeBgColor ++ "' -fn '" ++ userFont ++ "' -h '" ++ userBarHeight ++ "'"
 
-- ## Prompt (the program launcher)

-- the screen when the keybinding M-p is entered. See the keybindings section.

-- ## Workspace Info Bar (Top Left)

-- This is the configuration for the dzen bar that appears in the top left that shows workspaces, the
-- icon representing the current layout, and the active window's title. This

-- defines the layout for workspaces where a window has broadcast an urgent

--
-- The following layouts are used in this configuration:
-- 
-- * _tiled_: Windows are tiled vertically, the "master" window in the left
--   column and all other windows in the right column, stacked vertically.
-- * _Mirror tiled_: Windows are tiled horizontally, the "master" window in
--   the top row and all other windows in the bottom row, stacked horizontally.
-- * _simpleTabbed_: Active window is full-screen, but there are tabs at the
--   top to switch windows
-- * _Full_: Active window is full-screen

-- myLayoutHook is the variable that holds the list of layouts currently
-- employed in this configuration.

-- # WORKSPACES

-- These are the workspaces that will appear in the upper-left corner of the

-- aesthetically pleasing and less readable.
--
-- [Xdotool](http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/) is used to make
-- these guys clickable; if it is not installed, they will not be clickable. On
-- click, the Mod4 + the number of the workspace is triggered, If the mod key
-- is changed, this will need to be changed too. 
--
-- Dzen2 runs the workspaces list and the clickable tag
-- is relatively new, so you may need to build from source (e.g. the Arch package
-- is not recent enough, so
-- [dzen2-svn](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=19926) from the AUR is
-- required).
--
-- The images are expected to be found in the userImagePath specified earlier in the
-- file and MUST be absolute as $HOME and ~ will not work with dzen2. Boo.

-- # CUSTOM RULES

-- These are rules for specific applications (e.g. to float by default).
--
-- These hooks fire when a window matching any of the rules below is opened
-- while in Xmonad. This allows you to customize how windows work by default.
--
-- The only rules I have here are to specify that GIMP, mplayer, and 
-- others should float by default. In addition, any window with a name
-- of "Copying files" (for nautilus, pcmanfm, and thunar) should also be
-- floated. There are, however, many other kinds of rules that can be specified,
-- such as always opening an application on a specific workspace or in a 
-- particular position.
--
-- Rules are set here by specifying the class of the window, a property set
-- by the application that the X server sends to the window manager along
-- with other window properties. As the window class was not distinct
-- enough for the "copying files" dialogs (which should have been set by the
-- application as managed child windows to float automatically), I specified
-- the rule using a string property called "WM_NAME", which is literally the
-- name of the window.
--
-- You can determine the class name and other properties of a window with the
-- [xprop](http://www.xfree86.org/current/xprop.1.html) tool. To use xprop:
--
-- 1. run xprop from a terminal emulator from within a running X server. Your
-- cursor should change to a crosshair
-- 2. click on a window to see the xprop application print out details like
-- WM_CLASS (the className used below) or WM_NAME. 
--
-- For any property labeled "(STRING)" in the xprop info, you can add a
-- stringProperty rule to these hooks (like the "Copying Files" dialog below).
--
-- For more info on what kinds of rules you can set, see:
-- http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Doc-Extending.html#15
